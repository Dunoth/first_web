            <h2 id="backpacker">A backpacker in the coding world</h2>
            <p>Was being a backpacker during the last 5 years in Australia and New Zealand, the cultur, the people, the scenic, the attitude of living and working are all so different
                to what I saw in Taiwan, and that's why I want to experience. During the backpacker time what I mostly do is working in the farm and the vineyard as a seasonal worker. 
                I quiet enjoy the time and work experiences which I didn't have in Taiwan but everytime when the season finished I always questoined myself, <strong class="strong">What's next?</strong>
                <span>I would like to build a career which is stable growing and also full of creativity and doesn't easily to be replaced, as more as the informations I searched,
                the answer has become clearly, being a coding engineer is waht I looking for. The path to become the front/back-end engineer is not easy and full of challenges,
                but I love to take challenges and try my best to solve them, it's a whole new page in my life and have so many things are waiting for me to explore, can be said that
                I am the backpacker in the coding world.</span>

            <h2 id="develope">The way I develope myself into an engineer</h2>
            <p>There has so many resources you can use on the internet, from the website to the video, it has more possibilities for a self-learner to learn the coding now compared to decades ago.
                The website I choose to learn coding is called "Codecademy", it's one of the biggiest websites that teaches coding knowledge, and as a bigginer and have zero knowledge about coding,
                the career path to become a front-end engineer is where I start. <span>I learned the structures, the attributes, the elements of HTML, CSS and Javascript and how three of thme acting.
                I love how the way Codecademy teaches us by giving small projects after each chapters, that helps me to know more about what I learned and how I am able to use the knowledge.</span>

        </div>

        <div>
            <h2 id="experience">How much experience have I got?</h2>
            <p>Honestly, the time has been 1 month since I start learning, and the coding experience can be said not much, this website is the biggiest project I have
                made so far. The function and the style have lots of need to be improved and I will.
